    <S.Para>
      Since beginning my journey as a freelance developer nearly 10
      years ago, Iâ€™ve done remote work for agencies, consulted for
      startups, and collaborated with talented people to create web
      products for both business and consumer use.

      I create successful websites and services that are fast, easy to
      use, and built with best practices. The main area of my expertise
      is SPA development, both server-side and client-side.

      But before I became a web developer, I couldn&apos;t imagine
      myself to be anyone other than a 3d programmer. So I took an
      academic leave for several years to devote myself entirely to
      development of my own start-up project. During
      this time I had to make a living as a freelance web developer,
      but in the end I realized that I loved my part-time job as much
      as I loved 3d programming. So, for the next decade I gradually
      moved from e-commerce projects using CMS to framework-based
      website development, both backend and frontend.
      This is the short answer where my C++ knowledge comes from =)
